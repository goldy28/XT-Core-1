      <h1>Quick Hummus recipe</h1>
      <p>
        This recipe makes a quick tasty hummus, with no messing.During my
        travels, I learned many things. Some of those include that Hummus can be
        a dip, but is more often a meal. ; Hummus should not be thick and
        chunky; good hummus is fluffy, creamy, and silky smooth. ; You really,
        really, really just need to get over your laziness and use dried
        Chickpeas to make your hummus instead of canned, because it is so. dang.
        worth it. Itâ€™s really not that hard, I promise. I even broke it down
        into super easy steps for you guys!
